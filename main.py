# Information:
# For every eduction within Saxion, you can also do various small projects after the initial questions.
# The projects for every education are:
# * Applied Computer Science: small programming exercise in C++ (simple 'hello world' program - think about some IDE within an HTML frame).
# * Electrical Electronic Engineering: design a small PCB (deployment within an HTML frame - think about some kind of game).
# * Mechatronics: implement a robot with C++ (deployment within an HTML frame - think about some kind of game).
# * Industrial Product Design: design a simple case for a Raspberry Pi (deployment within an HTML frame - thing about some kind of game).
# Python is used for creating this webpages, due to the powerful aspects this programming language has.
